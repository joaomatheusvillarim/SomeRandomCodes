# SomeRandomCodes

Hi! Here in SomeRandomCodes you'll find, literally, some random codes that I've created during my journy on learning my first programming language
* It's all on Python 3 :snake:
* It has some challenges that I've solved :trophy:
* And some cool games, like Tic Tac Toe, Hangman and Rock Paper Scissors :video_game:


<h1> SomeRandomCodes </h1>
<h5> These codes were written when I was learning to write code on my own as a high school student (2018-2020) </h5>
<h5> They're not the best but when compared to the code I write nowadays it shows how much my skills improved. </h5>
